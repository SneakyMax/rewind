# Level 1 interaction texts



# Bedroom

dresser_1:
	interaction-text: >
		I can’t believe I have this still! So silky, so French... 
		Those first couple years when John couldn’t keep his hands off 
		me... Gracious! 
		
dresser_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Maybe he was just bored of this get-up? There was that 
		red thing in the catalogue… but so pricey!

dresser_3:
	interaction-text: >
		From the way people yammer on about it, you’d think it’d 
		be better?

bedroomDoor_1:
	interaction-text: >
		I locked the door? But where did I put that key? So forgetful! 

bedroomDoor_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I hope a mouse didn’t run off with it! Or that damned cat, Darwin.

bedroomDoor_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Hello? John Jr? Hello? I’m stuck!

bedroomKey_1:
	interaction-text: >
		How clumsy of me, right underfoot!

bed_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Getting up is just harder and harder. But the Lord 
		never gives us more than we can handle…

bed_2:
	interaction-text: >
		What a beautiful dream I had last night.

bed_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Oh I can’t sleep all day… can I?

broom_1:
	interaction-text: >
		I really should clean this house out. The mice
		are starting to think they own the place!

candle_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Oh! Here's my candle.




# Library

bookshelf1_1:
	interaction-text: >
		The Accidental Savior. John always did love his pulp. 
		This was the book he was reaching for when he 
		collapsed the first time...

bookshelf1_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Oh, who has time to read? There’s enough to be 
		done in a house like this to keep any responsible lady busy. 
		And anyways, all these stories, such nonsense.

bookshelf1_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Words, words, words.

bookshelf2_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Most of these were mom’s. I don’t know why she bought 
		them. To help with her crosswords?

bookshelf2_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I think she just didn’t know what to do after he was shot down, 
		and with grandma and grandpa so recently passed.

bookshelf2_3:
	interaction-text: >
		““Murray’s Hand-Book on the Islands of the Caribbean””

bookshelf3_1:
	interaction-text: >
		All my cookbooks! Only Mary was an adventurous eater. 
		That time I made curry and everyone flat-out refused to eat it, 
		everyone except her!

bookshelf3_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I guess after all that time my cooking still couldn’t match John’s mother’s.

bookshelf3_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Fish every Friday, steak on Saturday, a bird on Sunday...

piano_1:
	interaction-text: >
		What was that song Mary was always playing? I can hum it, 
		but what was the name?

piano_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I hope Mary’s doing well, though it’s probably too late to 
		hope for grandchildren from her.

piano_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Why didn’t I ever learn to play?




# Bathroom

toilet_1:
	interaction-text: >
		““A wife’s only as good as her toilet is clean!”...oh, mom.”

toilet_2:
	interaction-text: >
		“Mom was so proud to “live in the first house 
		in the county to have been built with a bathroom.””

toilet_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I hope I didn’t somehow flush the front door key!

mirror_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Oh, Sandy’s son’s wedding--Jason? Yes, little 
		Jason’s wedding. When she told me I was too old to dance! 
		I sure showed her!

mirror_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Sandy always was John’s little princess.

mirror_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Wrinkles! You ugly old thing.

bathtub_1:
	interaction-text: >
		The trouble with baths is you never feel fully clean afterwards.

bathtub_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I hate those rings but scrubbing is just too hard on my knees. 

bathtub_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I’ll clean it first thing tomorrow morning.

heartpills_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Thank goodness for my pills! What would I do if I ran out?




# Kitchen

oven_1:
	interaction-text: >
		“I really should have them all over for a ham; they all 
		like that so much. Like when John Jr was learning to 
		talk that Christmas and called everything “hom! hom!” all day!”

oven_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I can still smell all those delicious meals!

oven_3: 
	interaction-text: >
		With all that grease in there, it’d be sure to catch fire.

phone_1:
	interaction-text: >
		It’s so nice that John Jr takes care of the finances 
		since John’s passed, and so sad the economy is doing so 
		poorly! If only the country could get better, maybe he could 
		get the phone turned back on.

phone_2:
	interaction-text: >
		When John was alive we were so comfortable.

phone_3:
	interaction-text: >
		What a world, where you have to call someone to fix your phone!

kitchenSink_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Well, at least I’m done with dishes.

kitchenSink_2:
	interaction-text: >
		If Sandy inherits the house she better save up for a 
		dishwasher. I don’t think that girl has ever so much as gotten 
		her hands wet!

kitchenSink_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I should be better about saving water. John Jr says 
		the bills keep skyrocketing!

backDoor_1:
	interaction-text: >
		If only Darwin was an outdoor cat. That beast, I hate it I really do.

backDoor_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Go into the backyard! Out into the night! To think!

backDoor_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I’d get lost in the grass it’s grown so long!

refrigerator_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Next time I go to the store I’ve got to remember to 
		get more beer for when John Jr visits. A beer always 
		puts him in a better mood.

refrigerator_2:
	interaction-text: >
		If those mice ever figure out how to get in here!

refrigerator_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I just don’t have much of an appetite these days.



# Front Hall

stairs_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Of course I could make it up the stairs, but after that 
		last tumble John Jr was so angry, bless his heart. 
		I should talk to him about bringing those photo boxes 
		down, next time he visits.

stairs_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Of course you can’t expect them to live here all their lives! 
		Not in these modern times. Everyone’s a jet-setter! Mary’s 
		even in London of all places. I’d love to see London, 
		maybe meet the queen!

stairs_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I do wish I could spend some time in my childhood 
		room, if just an afternoon.

coatRack_1:
	interaction-text: >
		AH! Why are you in my hou--oh, just the coat rack!

coatRack_2:
	interaction-text: >
		If some scoundrel tried to force his way in here I 
		could tip this over onto him.

coatRack_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Wasn’t my fur hanging there? 

frontDoor_1:
	interaction-text: >
		And not even enough time to get milk from the 
		store. If John doesn’t smell the steak cooking when he 
		walks in the door… and it’s not going to cook itself. Oh, 
		silly Elle.

frontDoor_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Truth is, I haven’t wanted to go out much since John’s funeral. 
		It is nice when John Jr drives me to church, but I hardly know 
		anyone there anymore. Even Father O’… Father 
		O’-What’s-His-Name! Ha!

frontDoor_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I should get going. But where I’d leave the house keys?



# Living Room

wallpaper_1:
	interaction-text: >
		I was so excited to put that wallpaper in but nobody 
		really said anything about it, except mom of course, 
		who got so mean near the end there.

wallpaper_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I’ll have to find the glue and tamp down these peeling edges. 

wallpaper_3:
	interaction-text: >
		How many mice can be in there?

sofa_1:
	interaction-text: >
		I used to tease John he should just call this 
		his bed he was always falling asleep here. Every 
		morning, snoring up a storm, his scotch glass 
		balanced on his belly, what a sight!

sofa_2:
	interaction-text: >
		His indentation is right where he left it.

sofa_3:
	interaction-text: >
		Oh, it’s too dusty to sit on now. 

tv_1:
	interaction-text: >
		That blasted thing. How many screaming fights did 
		John Jr and Sandy have over those silly shows they 
		wanted to watch?

tv_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Every time I took sides the other one would start screaming at me!

tv_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I suppose it is nice hearing the news about the stars though.

comfyChair_1:
	interaction-text: >
		The best place in the house for remembering the good times. 
		But I don’t have time for that now, I have something to do, don’t I?

comfyChair_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I was going to go to something? I’m sure I’ll remember on 
		the way to the car.

comfyChair_3:
	interaction-text: >
		If I sit down now I’ll just nap all day.



# Dining Room

diningTable_1:
	interaction-text: >
		I’d love to have the family all together again but it’d 
		just be too much to cook a meal big enough for all of them.

diningTable_2:
	interaction-text: >
		I loved watching John carve a bird. When he’d 
		concentrate like that he looked just like a little boy!

diningTable_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I bet the trees that were used to make the table and the 
		trees that were used to make the walls were neighbors.


# End Game

wakeup_1:
	interaction-text: >
		What happened...? Was that... a dream?

wakeup_2:
	interaction-text: >
		Oof. Everything aches. My hips, my back. My head...

wakeup_3:
	interaction-text: >
		I am definitely getting too old for this.

cleanhouse_1:
	interaction-text: >
		Well I think that does it! Everything spic-and-span. Now,
		I've been cooped up long enough in here. Perhaps it's time
		to go out on the town? And here are the house keys too, in 
		my pocket this whole time!
